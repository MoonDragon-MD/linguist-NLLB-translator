## Advice
To also have the offline translation you can use
1) Bergamot, use firefox's built-in offline translator (it is already in the settings of the translation add-on)
2) LibreTranslate offline (change to http:localhost:5000):
[LibreTranslator.js](https://github.com/translate-tools/linguist-translators/blob/master/translators/LibreTranslator.js) 
3) [linguist-WindowsTTS](https://github.com/MoonDragon-MD/linguist-WindowsTTS)  to have native Windows/linux offline TTS
